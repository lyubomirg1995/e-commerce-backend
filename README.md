## Description

An Express.js API was configured to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database for the creation of a backend for an e-commerce site. The application displays the creation of a mySQL database with models and associations. API routes perform RESTful CRUD functions, as shown in the walkthrough video.

## Installation

1. After cloning the repository, install node.js, express.js, and sequelize.
2. Run 'mysql -u root -p' and enter your mySQL password in the .env file
3. Run 'npm run seed' to seed the file
4. Run 'npm start' to connect to the server

## Usage
The application is supposed to allow the user to view, add, update, and delete products, categories, and tags in Insomnia.
